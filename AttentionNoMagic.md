# No-Magic Explanation of Attention Score Calculation (Q · K)

When we talk about "attention weights assigned by 'jumps' to each of the previous words," we often introduce labels like **Query (Q)** and **Key (K)**. But these are just names — the actual mechanism doesn't inherently understand what a "query" or a "key" is.

Instead, what's happening is this:

## 🔢 Learnable Vector Projections

Each word in a sentence is represented by an **embedding vector** — a learned, fixed-size list of numbers (e.g., `[0.3, 0.8]`) that captures properties of the word.

To perform attention, we apply two **separate learnable matrices** to each embedding:

```python
Q = Wq @ embedding   # Treating the embedding as a column vector
K = Wk @ embedding
```

- `Wq` and `Wk` are weight matrices with **random values at first**
- Over training, they are updated through **gradient descent**

These projections create two new vector spaces:
- One for comparing from the perspective of the current word (Q)
- One for being compared against (K)

## ⚙️ The Actual Score Calculation

### The Math (Concrete Example)
You have a vector `Q_jumps` (produced by `Wq @ embedding_jumps`)

You have a set of vectors `[K_The, K_quick, K_brown, K_fox]` (each from `Wk @ embedding_word`)

You compute:

```python
scores = [Q_jumps · K_The,
          Q_jumps · K_quick,
          Q_jumps · K_brown,
          Q_jumps · K_fox]
```

These scores have no built-in semantics — they just reflect how aligned these learned vector projections are.

✅ The truth:  
While we call them “query” and “key,” they’re just two separate projections of the input embeddings.

There is:
- No “real query”
- No “real key”
- Just a learned direction and comparison function


To determine how much one word should "attend to" another, we compute the **dot product** of the two projected vectors:

```python
score = dot(Q_jumps, K_fox)
```

This score reflects how **aligned** the two vectors are — in other words, how much the model thinks the current word should be influenced by the other word.

But again, there's **no built-in semantics** here. The model doesn't "know":
- Which word is a subject or object
- Which word is acting on which

It just sees:
> “Here's a vector. Here's another. Take their dot product.”

---

## 🎯 Why Does This Work?

It works because of **training pressure**. Over time:
- The model learns to adjust `Wq` and `Wk`
- So that the dot products (i.e., attention scores) are **high** when a word should be attended to
- And **low** when it shouldn't

That pressure comes from the final prediction task — e.g., if the model gets the next word wrong, it adjusts every piece of the path that led to that prediction.

So if `Q_jumps` pointed too much at `K_quick` instead of `K_fox`, gradients flow to reduce that alignment next time.

## 🏁 Final Step: From Context Vector to Word Prediction

Once the context vector is computed (as a weighted sum of V vectors), the model uses it to **predict the next word** in the sequence.

This is done by comparing the context vector to all word vectors in the vocabulary using a **vocab projection matrix**:

```python
logits = context_vector @ W_vocab.T
```

Where:
- `W_vocab` is a learnable matrix where each row corresponds to a word in the vocabulary
- The dot product measures how closely the context vector aligns with each vocab word

Then, the logits are passed through softmax:

```python
probs = softmax(logits)
```

And the word with the highest probability is selected as the prediction:

```python
predicted_word = argmax(probs)
```

So the entire process — from Q/K alignment, to V blending, to prediction — is just a structured series of vector operations and gradient-driven updates.

No magic. Just math, projections, and optimization.

## 🔄 Rethinking Q/K/V – Relational vs Intrinsic Properties

We can interpret the attention mechanism as separating two distinct functions:

### ✅ Q and K → **Relational Properties**
These are context-aware projections used to measure **how words relate to each other**.

- `Q_jumps` = How "jumps" is looking to connect with others
- `K_fox`   = How "fox" presents itself to be attended to

The dot product `Q · K` measures how much alignment exists — it is the basis of attention weight.

### ✅ V → **Intrinsic Properties**
This is a projection of the original embedding that carries the **informational content** of a word.

- V does not participate in scoring — it contributes to the **final output**
- You can think of it as: “What this word offers to the overall meaning if it gets attended to.”

### 🔁 Process Summary:
1. Start with base embeddings for each word
2. Project them into:
   - Q: seeking relation (per current word)
   - K: offering identity (per all words)
   - V: offering content (per all words)
3. Use dot(Q, K) to get scores
4. Apply softmax to get weights
5. Use those weights to combine V vectors — a **context-aware blend** of the word content

This helps us separate:
- **Scoring functions** → via Q and K
- **Content representation** → via V

All learned via backprop — no manual semantics, just structure guided by loss.

This setup doesn't work because we told the model what Q and K mean. It works because:
- Q and K are **used in different parts of the attention computation**
- Gradients flow differently through each
- That causes their learned projections to **naturally specialize**

So you can think of Q and K as:
> “Two differently transformed versions of the same input embedding — one used to compare, one to be compared.”

Their alignment becomes the attention score.

And that’s it — no magic. Just math and training loops.
